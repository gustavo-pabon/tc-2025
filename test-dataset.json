Additionally, \nwe provided more than 850,000 people with access to \nclean water and sanitation solutions, including 163,000 \nin Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico.\nWe are firmly focused on achieving \nour 2030 commitments and making \nthe right long-term investments that \nsupport the sustainability of our \nbusiness for decades to come. \nZero waste \nWe increased our reuse and recycle rates of all cloud \nhardware to 82 percent and continue to pace toward \nour 2030 reuse and recycle goal of 90 percent. We also \nreduced single-use plastics across all Microsoft \nproduct packaging to 3.3 percent and are on track to \neliminate their use by 2025. In total, we have diverted \n12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills. \nEcosystem protection \nWe continue to maintain our commitment to protect \nmore land than we use. In 2022, 12,000 of the over \n17,000 acres of contracted land were officially \ndesignated as protected.

When we announced \nour commitment in 2020 to become carbon \nnegative by 2030, we pledged to use our voice \non public policy issues to help advance global \ndecarbonization efforts. \nWe understand that public policies will play a critical \nrole, both in creating signals to spur the economic and \nsocial transition required to address climate change \nand in building the foundations of markets to develop \nand deliver innovative goods, services, and skills to \nachieve that transition. However, there is a growing \ngap between the pace of desired policy outcomes \nand economic and scientific indicators that show \naccelerating climate impacts. To help close this gap and \nsupport communities and companies in their efforts to \nachieve their climate pledges, governments around the \nworld need to accelerate policy action. \nKey projects \nAdvocating for robust policy in carbon, \nelectricity, water, waste, and ecosystems \nOver the past year we have deepened our \npolicy engagement on carbon, electricity, waste, \nand ecosystems. \nIn the United States, we advocated for climate \nand energy investments as part of the recent US \ninfrastructure and climate laws, including the \nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation \nReduction Act. In addition, we shared our support for a \nrobust and consistent framework for climate disclosure \nrequirements by the US Securities and Exchange \nCommission and provided comments to the requests \nfor information climate disclosure for US federal \nprocurement. Microsoft continued to encourage tree \nplanting and reforestation efforts through our support \nof the Trillion Trees Act, as well as efforts to improve \nthe health of old-growth forests by supporting the \nSave Our Sequoias Act. At the state level, we supported \nlegislative and regulatory efforts to accelerate the clean \nenergy transition by encouraging the integration of \nzero-emission generation and improving the resilience \nof the electric grid. \nWe continue to use our voice on public \npolicy issues to help advance global \ndecarbonization efforts. \nIn the European Union, we supported a comprehensive \ndecarbonization plan with ambitious measures to \nscale uptake of renewable energy, and informed \nEurope's emergency measures to face the energy \ncrisis. We actively engaged in the development of \nthe regulatory framework for the certification of \ncarbon removals, calling for strict standards for \nhigh-quality, accountable, and long-lasting carbon \nremovals. As Europe leads the way on upgraded \ntransparency and disclosure of environmental, social, \nand governance information across global value chains, \nwe have endorsed the buildout of a level playing \nfield for corporate sustainability reporting. We have \nalso engaged and supported the drive to increase \nthe circularity of devices, boost transparency and \nefficiency in waste management policies, and empower \nconsumers with better information. \nGlobally, Microsoft advocated for public policies \nto accelerate climate action; invest in mitigation, \nadaptation, and a just transition; and align international \nclimate reporting and disclosure rules. At COP27, \nMicrosoft called on countries to remain committed \nto the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. \nIn response to the UN Secretary-General's call to action \nto develop early warning systems for all within the next \nfive years, Microsoft joined global leaders in support of \nthis initiative while highlighting the fundamental role \nthat technology can play in these efforts. \nAdvocating for social and economic policies that address \nclimate change is pivotal to our sustainability journey."

Google\u2019s hardware includes \ndata center servers, networking equipment, and consumer hardware products. These extended categories have been reported annually from 2018 onward.\n32. In 2020, due to the global pandemic, we began to estimate and report on our emissions associated with teleworking (i.e., employees working remotely). We applied the estimation \nmethodology outlined in EcoAct\u2019s Homeworking Emissions Whitepaper to our annual average workforce to estimate the GHG emissions generated by employees working remotely \nfrom their homes. Teleworking emissions are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions for employee commuting, per Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s Technical Guidance for Calculating \nScope 3 Emissions (version 1.0). For a breakdown of our operational Scope 3 emissions by category, see our 2021 Independent Accountants\u2019 Review Report.\n33. In 2020, we began reporting teleworking emissions as part of our Scope 3 employee commuting emissions. Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting) emissions  \nreported prior to 2020 do not include teleworking emissions.\n34. See note 31 above.\n35. We calculate two metrics for operational emissions, one using market-based Scope 2 and one using location-based Scope 2. The Scope 2 market-based and location-based amounts \nhave been third-party assured by Ernst & Young LLP, as shown in the Schedule of Select Environmental Indicators attached to the 2021 Independent Accountants\u2019 Review Report.  \nIn the 2021 Independent Accountants\u2019 Review Report, the Schedule of Operational GHG emissions After Compensation Adjustments only includes the market-based metric.\n36. In 2016, we adopted the industry practice of including only operational emissions in our carbon neutrality commitment. For more information, see our 2017 white paper,  \n10 Years of Carbon Neutrality. In 2020, we extended our operational emissions boundary to include teleworking emissions. The operational emissions included in our carbon  \nneutrality commitment now include Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting, including teleworking).\n37. Emissions reduced by renewable energy PPAs are calculated by subtracting Scope 2 market-based method (MBM) GHG emissions from Scope 2 location-based method GHG \nemissions, thereby representing emissions reductions from renewable energy PPAs and MBM emission factors.\n38. See note 36 above.\n39. Carbon intensity metrics are based on gross global combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions. For more information on year-over-year changes to market-based  \nScope 2 emissions, see note 29 above.\n40. Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable sources.\n41. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations  \n(i.e., renewable energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities are located) with the \ntotal volume of electricity consumed by our operations. This metric includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. \nPrior to 2016, we were not accounting for the renewable electricity purchased through grid electricity.\n42. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u2019s Scope 2 Guidance requires energy attribute certificates to be sourced from and applied to the same market in which the reporting entity\u2019s  \nelectricity-consuming operations are located. This guidance does not recognize existing renewable energy on the electric grids where an entity\u2019s operations are located.\n43. Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis. This is calculated \nusing both CFE under contract by Google as well as CFE coming from the overall grid mix. CFE coming from the overall grid mix is based on data obtained from a third-party, \nelectricityMap, and has not been assured. For more information, see our 2021 white paper, 24\/7 Carbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics.\n44. Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery.\n45.",
            "Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP. Carbon \ndioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1.\n28. Since 2010, we\u2019ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall emissions. Until 2015, there was no guidance from the \nGreenhouse Gas Protocol on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity \nprocured against electricity consumed (in megawatt-hours) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released updated  \nScope 2 guidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data.\n29. Google currently buys enough renewable energy to match our annual global electricity consumption. To achieve our 100% renewable energy match goal, we first consider both \nour on-site renewable energy generation and the renewable energy that is already in the electric grids where our facilities are located, then procure renewable energy through PPA \ncontracts. We have a few facilities located in geographies where we\u2019re not currently able to source large volumes of renewable energy, so we currently make up for this by buying \nsurplus renewable energy in regions where it\u2019s abundant. For example, by buying larger amounts of wind energy in places like Europe, we compensate for our lack of renewable energy \npurchases in Asia. This approach results in Google\u2019s Scope 2 market-based emissions being greater than zero as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, despite us \nachieving our 100% renewable energy match globally. To work toward eliminating GHG emissions associated with our electricity use (Scope 2 market-based emissions), we set the \nambitious goal of achieving 24\/7 carbon-free energy by 2030. To attain this, we\u2019re evolving from matching our annual energy consumption with renewable energy to sourcing  \ncarbon-free energy every hour of every day, everywhere.\n30.

            "IntroductionSustainability\nDriving Climate SolutionsCarbon\nPeopleAppendix\nEmbodied Carbon\nAWS strives to reduce embodied carbon associated with \nconcrete and steel, the two most carbon-intensive materials \nused to build our data centers. This includes carbon emitted \nduring extraction, manufacturing, and transportation of \nmaterials to data center construction sites. \nWe are working with various suppliers on lower-carbon \nconc\nrete options. For example, in Northern Virginia, AWS \nworked with building material provider Holcim to procure \nECOPact concrete for several data centers. The concrete mix \nreduces carbon emissions by nearly 40% compared to standard \nconcrete. AWS worked with American Rock Products (ARP), a \nCRH Company, to develop a more sustainable concrete mix \nfor data centers across northeastern Oregon. ARP completed \nEnvironmental Product Declarations, which summarize \nenvironmental impacts across the concrete\u2019s lifecycle, for all \nproducts at their plants. Globally in 2022, we completed the \nconstruction of 16 data centers using lower-carbon concrete \nand 10 data centers using lower-carbon steel. We expect these \nnumbers to grow considerably in 2023.\nWe are also focused on reducing embodied emissions \nas\nsociated with the manufacturing of AWS hardware, including \nsilicon-based devices like processors and solid-state drives. \nAs these emissions are primarily from material extraction \nand product manufacturing, the path to decarbonizing chip \nproduction involves all parts of the lifecycle. To address this, we \nare working with suppliers to improve their energy efficiency \nand power their operations with more renewable energy.\nKeeping Technologies in Use Longer\nWe are reducing emissions related to server use \nand networking equipment by increasing server \nlifespan. This includes refining software to run \nmore efficiently, subsequently lowering stress on \nhardware and extending its useful life.\u00a0In 2022, \nwe extended AWS server life from four years to \nfive and networking equipment life from five \nyears to\u00a0six. To support these efforts, AWS has a \nrobust maintenance and repair program designed \nto increase component reuse and further reduce \ncarbon emissions and waste across our supply chain.\nTo help prevent our equipment from ending up \nin landfills and avoid associat\ned emissions, we are \ninvesting in responsible end-of-life management \nsystems. AWS uses reverse logistics hubs to \nevaluate and reuse electronic equipment in our \nglobal data center fleet. These hubs help us \nconsolidate, assess, and recirculate functional \nequipment back into our inventory. When we no \nlonger have use for equipment, we remove all \ncustomer data and sell the equipment on the \nsecondary market for reuse or work with a network \nof experienced vendors to recycle parts.\nTo extend the useful life of data center hardware, AWS sends all functional, \nsanitized, retired server racks and components to its reverse logistics hubs.\nCarbon Neutralization\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \nmade clear that significant carbon emissions from several \nsectors of the economy will not be fully abated by 2050.14\u00a0Even \nwith aggressive decarbonization efforts, many companies \nwill need to neutralize some GHG\u00a0emissions\u00a0that cannot be \neliminated to achieve net-zero carbon.\nCarbon neutralization represents an opportunity for us to \nhe\nlp reduce emissions and stabilize our changing climate. \nWe are focused on three global transformations: halting \ntropical rainforest loss, restoring degraded land, and scaling \ntechnologies that capture carbon emissions. \nLearn more about how, in 2022, Amazon analyzed and \ninvest\ned in various promising carbon-removal technologies \nthrough The Climate Pledge Fund \n.\nProtecting the World\u2019s \nTropical\u00a0Rainforests\nTropical deforestation contributes approximately one-fifth \nof global emissions.15 Ending deforestation will require more \neffective government policy, local stakeholder collaboration, \nand new pathways for sustainable economic development in \ntropical forest regions. \nIn 2021, Amazon helped create the Lowering Emissions \nby A\nccelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, which has \nmobilized over\u00a0$1 billion in corporate and government finance \nto protect tropical rainforests around the world. In 2022, \nduring COP27, four Brazilian states signed Letters of Intent to \nparticipate in the Coalition, bringing participating tropical forest \njurisdictions to nine. \nRestoring Degraded Landscapes\nRestoring landscapes has the potential to remove billions of \ntons of carbon emissions while improving local livelihoods. \nAmazon is focused specifically on advancing restoration efforts \nby the world\u2019s smallholder farmers through programs like the \nAgroforestry and Restoration Accelerator\u00a0\n  in Brazil.",
            "IntroductionSustainabilityPeopleAppendix\nOpening \nLetter From \nKara Hurst\nReflecting on the last year, I\u2019m proud of the work our teams \naround the world have accomplished and I\u2019m excited about \nwhat\u2019s ahead. We have taken important steps forward in our \nsocial, community, and environmental work, while always \nexpanding our vision for the future. At the center of it all is our \ncustomer obsession. Sustainability is an important issue for our \ncustomers around the world, and we are continually investing, \ninventing, and improving to make every customer interaction \nmore sustainable than the last.\nThis isn\u2019t a distant vision for the future\u2014this work is well \nunderway now. Take our e-commerce business. From the \nmoment a customer clicks \u201cBuy Now\u201d to when their package \narrives on their doorstep, we have teams of scientists and \nengineers working to make that process more sustainable, all \nwithout compromising on speed, safety, or convenience. We \nare deploying new building technologies, such as low-carbon \nconcrete, to make our facilities more sustainable\u2014as seen in \nthe launch of our second headquarters buildings, which set \na new standard for sustainable design. We are investing in \nrenewable energy around the world, and we are the largest \ncorporate buyer of renewable energy in the world for the third \nyear in a row. Our teams are analyzing routes and distances to \nbuild a logistics system that gets packages to customers faster, \nwith fewer emissions. And we are transitioning our fleet to roll \nout 100,000 Rivian electric delivery vehicles by 2030, with \nthousands on the road now. \nAnd that\u2019s just a small part of our story. While our most \nvisible sustainability work may be in how we deliver orders \nto customers\u2019 doorsteps, we are more than an e-commerce \ncompany. Amazon is an entertainment studio, cloud provider, \ngrocer, and more\u2014and we are making sustainability a priority \nacross all of our businesses.\nFor example, sustainability might not be top of mind when \nyou tune in to watch your favorite Amazon Original series, \nbut it is for us. We are reducing the use of fossil fuels from \nour production studios, deploying battery-electric generators, \nusing solar-powered cast trailers, and scaling the use of electric \nvehicles on our sets. We are doing all of this in the background \nwhile delivering exciting new shows for our customers.\nCloud computing also plays a role in reducing our customers\u2019 \nenvironmental impact. With Amazon Web Services (AWS), \ncustomers no longer run their own data centers, which often \noperate at low utilization rates, leading to a lot of wasted \nenergy. Instead, customers can take advantage of the advanced \nengineering of AWS data centers that utilize some of the most \nhighly reliable, secure, energy-efficient hardware in the world. \nAWS can lower customers\u2019 workload carbon footprints by \nnearly 80% versus on-premises computing workload, and we \nexpect that number to increase once AWS is fully powered by \nrenewable energy.\nIn the communities where we operate, we are also doing our \npart to help solve rapidly growing challenges facing the world \ntoday. Take water scarcity as an example. Amid unprecedented \ndroughts around the world, we committed that by 2030, AWS \ndata centers will return more water to communities than they \nuse in their direct operations. \nNo matter the industry, from entertainment to grocery to \ncloud computing, we are determined to show the world that if \nwe can do this, others can too. In many cases, our work sends \nimportant demand signals to the market, which helps drive \nmore renewable energy, more-sustainable building materials, \nand other innovations that help businesses and organizations \naround the world reduce their own impact on the environment. \nScaling our positive impact is underpinned by The Climate \nPledge\u2014a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040\u2014which \nwe co-founded in 2019. The Pledge invites every sector that \ntouches our business (and those that don\u2019t) to make their own \nambitious climate commitments. We are creating a community \nthat inspires each other to do more, and to out-innovate even \nourselves as we know we can\u2019t do this alone. More than 390 \ncompanies across 36 countries signed the Pledge by the end of \n2022, and we are determined to keep bringing on new partners \nto help combat climate change. \nWe are also committed to supporting third parties in their \nown decarbonization efforts. Amazon has one of the largest \nvalue chains in the world."

            "IntroductionSustainability\nDriving Climate SolutionsRenewable Energy\nPeopleAppendix\nOur Approach\nTo achieve our renewable energy goal, we aim for 100% of the \nelectricity we use to be attributable to renewable electricity \nsources. This goal covers all Amazon businesses, including \noperations facilities, corporate offices, physical stores, AWS \ndata centers, and all financially integrated subsidiaries that \nsupport hundreds of millions of customers globally. \nSunshades on the exterior of Met Park improve energy efficiency by reducing \ndirect sunlight into the building, saving cooling energy and decreasing glare.\nBy scaling renewable energy, we aim to make Amazon a more \nresilient, sustainable business and drive a global transition to \ncleaner energy. We contract renewable power from utility-scale \nwind and solar projects that add clean energy to the grid. Many \nof these projects are enabled by long-term contracts such as \npower purchase agreements (PPAs) for large projects in the \nsame energy grids as our electricity use. Energy load forecasts \nhelp guide procurement decisions.\u00a0\nIncreasing renewable energy use requires a targeted, \nmultif\naceted approach, and we are taking action to achieve our \ngoal in the following ways:\n\u2022 Energy efficiency: We innovate to continually increase the \nenergy eff\niciency of our operations and devices.\n\u2022 Scaling renewable energy: We are invest ing in renewables \nboth on-site (as rooftop solar on buildings we operate) and \noff-site (through PPAs) through investing in new, utility-\nscale wind and solar projects. We also participate in green \ntariff programs with utilities and pursue new renewable \nprojects through competitive site energy contracts.\n\u2022 Energy storage solutions:\u00a0We are expanding renewable \nenergy s\ntorage capacity to help support grid transitions to \n100%  renewables.\n\u2022 Energy optimization: We are improv ing data collection \nand analysis to better understand operational energy \nrequirements, informing our renewable procurement \ndecisions and energy-optimization initiatives.\n\u2022 Advocating for renewable energy solutions: We engage in  \npublic policy that advances access to and the expansion of \nclean energy for Amazon and our customers.\nOur Progress\nScaling Renewable Energy\u00a0\nIn 2022,\u00a090%\u00a0of electricity consumed by Amazon was \nattributable to renewable energy sources, up from 85% \nin 2021. We grew our renewables portfolio to over 20 GW \nof clean energy capacity, a 67% increase from our global \n2021 portfolio of just over\u00a012 GW. Once operational, these \ncontracted renewable energy projects will account for\u00a056,881 \ngigawatt-hours (GWh) of Amazon\u2019s electricity use, enough to \npower 5.3 million U.S. homes annually. With these continued \ninvestments, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most \nrenewable energy announced by a single company in one year, \nand we remain the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy \nfor the third year in a row. \nAs a part of our broader commitment to power our operations \nwith 100\n% renewable energy, we continue to scale up our use \nof renewable electricity within AWS. In 2022, the electricity \nconsumed in the following 19 AWS regions was attributable \nto 100% renewable energy: U.S. East (Northern Virginia), \nGovCloud (U.S. East), U.S. East (Ohio), U.S. West (Oregon), \nGovCloud (U.S. West), U.S. West (Northern California), Canada \n(Central), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (London), \nEurope (Milan), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Europe \n(Spain), Europe (Zurich), Asia-Pacific (Mumbai), Asia-Pacific \n(Hyderabad), China (Beijing), and China (Ningxia).\u00a0\nOn-Site Solar Projects\nIn 2022, three new on-site rooftop solar projects became \noperational at Japanese fulfillment centers, increasing the \nnumber of facilities with on-site solar in Japan to six. In October \n2022, we opened our first stand-alone Australian sort center \nin Melbourne, which features 3,078 on-site solar panels with \ncapacity to meet up to 80% of the site\u2019s electricity needs.\u00a0We \nalso announced on-site solar projects in Canada, France, and \nGermany throughout the year.\nUtility-Scale Projects\nDuring 2022, we\u00a0announced 133 new renewable energy \nprojects that are expected to come online over the next\u00a0five \nyears, bringing our total announced\u00a0projects\u00a0to 401 as of \nJanuary 2023. Notably, for off-site projects, we announced \nour first South American project\u00a0\n , a 122-MW solar farm in \nBrazil."

            "IntroductionSustainability\nDriving Climate SolutionsCarbon\nPeopleAppendix\nEmbodied Carbon\nAWS strives to reduce embodied carbon associated with \nconcrete and steel, the two most carbon-intensive materials \nused to build our data centers. This includes carbon emitted \nduring extraction, manufacturing, and transportation of \nmaterials to data center construction sites. \nWe are working with various suppliers on lower-carbon \nconc\nrete options. For example, in Northern Virginia, AWS \nworked with building material provider Holcim to procure \nECOPact concrete for several data centers. The concrete mix \nreduces carbon emissions by nearly 40% compared to standard \nconcrete. AWS worked with American Rock Products (ARP), a \nCRH Company, to develop a more sustainable concrete mix \nfor data centers across northeastern Oregon. ARP completed \nEnvironmental Product Declarations, which summarize \nenvironmental impacts across the concrete\u2019s lifecycle, for all \nproducts at their plants. Globally in 2022, we completed the \nconstruction of 16 data centers using lower-carbon concrete \nand 10 data centers using lower-carbon steel. We expect these \nnumbers to grow considerably in 2023.\nWe are also focused on reducing embodied emissions \nas\nsociated with the manufacturing of AWS hardware, including \nsilicon-based devices like processors and solid-state drives. \nAs these emissions are primarily from material extraction \nand product manufacturing, the path to decarbonizing chip \nproduction involves all parts of the lifecycle. To address this, we \nare working with suppliers to improve their energy efficiency \nand power their operations with more renewable energy.\nKeeping Technologies in Use Longer\nWe are reducing emissions related to server use \nand networking equipment by increasing server \nlifespan. This includes refining software to run \nmore efficiently, subsequently lowering stress on \nhardware and extending its useful life.\u00a0In 2022, \nwe extended AWS server life from four years to \nfive and networking equipment life from five \nyears to\u00a0six. To support these efforts, AWS has a \nrobust maintenance and repair program designed \nto increase component reuse and further reduce \ncarbon emissions and waste across our supply chain.\nTo help prevent our equipment from ending up \nin landfills and avoid associat\ned emissions, we are \ninvesting in responsible end-of-life management \nsystems. AWS uses reverse logistics hubs to \nevaluate and reuse electronic equipment in our \nglobal data center fleet. These hubs help us \nconsolidate, assess, and recirculate functional \nequipment back into our inventory. When we no \nlonger have use for equipment, we remove all \ncustomer data and sell the equipment on the \nsecondary market for reuse or work with a network \nof experienced vendors to recycle parts.\nTo extend the useful life of data center hardware, AWS sends all functional, \nsanitized, retired server racks and components to its reverse logistics hubs.\nCarbon Neutralization\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \nmade clear that significant carbon emissions from several \nsectors of the economy will not be fully abated by 2050.14\u00a0Even \nwith aggressive decarbonization efforts, many companies \nwill need to neutralize some GHG\u00a0emissions\u00a0that cannot be \neliminated to achieve net-zero carbon.\nCarbon neutralization represents an opportunity for us to \nhe\nlp reduce emissions and stabilize our changing climate. \nWe are focused on three global transformations: halting \ntropical rainforest loss, restoring degraded land, and scaling \ntechnologies that capture carbon emissions. \nLearn more about how, in 2022, Amazon analyzed and \ninvest\ned in various promising carbon-removal technologies \nthrough The Climate Pledge Fund \n.\nProtecting the World\u2019s \nTropical\u00a0Rainforests\nTropical deforestation contributes approximately one-fifth \nof global emissions.15 Ending deforestation will require more \neffective government policy, local stakeholder collaboration, \nand new pathways for sustainable economic development in \ntropical forest regions. \nIn 2021, Amazon helped create the Lowering Emissions \nby A\nccelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, which has \nmobilized over\u00a0$1 billion in corporate and government finance \nto protect tropical rainforests around the world. In 2022, \nduring COP27, four Brazilian states signed Letters of Intent to \nparticipate in the Coalition, bringing participating tropical forest \njurisdictions to nine. \nRestoring Degraded Landscapes\nRestoring landscapes has the potential to remove billions of \ntons of carbon emissions while improving local livelihoods. \nAmazon is focused specifically on advancing restoration efforts \nby the world\u2019s smallholder farmers through programs like the \nAgroforestry and Restoration Accelerator\u00a0\n  in Brazil."

            "Resources \nNatural resources make our work possible \u2014 \nand we take responsibility for how we source, \nuse, and recycle the materials we rely on to \ncreate our products. As a starting point, this \nmeans sourcing responsibly, minimizing our \nfreshwater use, and eliminating waste across \nour operations and those of our suppliers. \nAnd we\u2019re also seeking to redefine the overall \nresource footprint of our products. Our goal is  \nto one day make products using only responsibly \nsourced recycled and renewable materials.\nWithin resources, we focus on three main  \nareas of impact:\n\u2022 Materials: Transitioning to only recycled \nor renewable materials in our products \nand packaging, and maximizing material \nefficiency, product longevity, and recovery.\n\u2022 Water: Reducing water impacts in the \nmanufacturing of our products, use of our \nservices, and operation of our facilities.  \nAt the same time, transitioning to alternative \nsources, improving the quality of water \nwe discharge, and protecting shared \nwater resources.\n\u2022 Zero waste: Minimizing overall waste \ngenerated and eliminating waste sent to \nlandfill from our manufacturing supply chain \nas well as corporate offices, data centers,  \nand retail stores.\nMaterials\nWe aim to make the best use of the materials we \nrely on to make our products. That\u2019s why we\u2019re \nfocusing on three different levers to reduce \nour footprint and achieve circularity: sourcing \nand efficiency; product longevity; and product \nend-of-life.\nSourcing and efficiency\nLast year, we made progress across materials \u2014 \nfrom expanding our use of recycled rare earth \nelements to designing cameras with recycled \ngold. In September, we introduced iPhone 13, \nwith more certified recycled materials than any \nprevious version of iPhone. We also introduced \n100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures on \nevery single model in the iPad lineup.\nWelcoming the first class of the Impact Accelerator \nLast year, we welcomed the first class to our Impact Accelerator, a program for Black-\n,Hispanic\/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses headquartered in the United States \nthat share our focus on innovation and our commitment to the environment. Part of Apple\u2019s \nRacial Equity and Justice Initiative (see page 60 ), the Accelerator aims to help combat \nsystemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for communities \nmost impacted by climate change. \nWe selected our first class of 15 businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and \nclean energy to begin the program in August 2021. The three-month program included live \nvirtual sessions, online courses on supply chain management, supplier diversity, financial \nand legal subjects, as well as one-on-one mentorship with an Apple expert on topics from \nrenewable energy to responsible sourcing.\nThe goal of the Impact Accelerator is to better position the participating companies for \ngrowth, to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts, and to expand their customer \nbase \u2014 all while fostering their environmental commitment. For example, last October we \nannounced that we will be working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by six \nSioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources, on a project to create  \na wind power development in the Midwest. And following the success of this year\u2019s class, \nour efforts continue. This spring, applications opened for the next class to join our  \nImpact Accelerator.\nFor Apple\u2019s inaugural Impact Accelerator, leaders from 15 companies participated  \nin a three-month virtual program with customized training and access to Apple  \nexpert mentors.\n20%\nIn fiscal year 2021, nearly 20 percent of \nthe\u00a0material we shipped in products came  \nfrom recycled and renewable sources\n2x\nIn fiscal year 2021, we more than doubled \nour use of recycled tungsten, rare earth \nelements, and cobalt \u2014 and introduced \ncertified recycled gold for the first time  \nin an Apple product\n75%\nWe\u2019ve reduced the plastic in our packaging \nby 75 percent compared with 2015, \nprogressing toward our goal to eliminate  \nall plastic from our packaging by 2025\nAppendixGovernanceCommunitiesSuppliers CustomersOur PeopleEnvironmentIntroduction \nApple\u2019s 2022 ESG Report   18"

            "IntroductionSustainability\nReducing Packaging and WastePackaging\nPeopleAppendix\nMinimizing Packaging Waste\nAutomated, right-sized packaging is key to advancing \nour sustainability efforts; where it isn\u2019t possible, we seek \nto optimize the packaging size and weight options our \nfulfillment centers can choose from.\nWe have developed a web-based tool to minimize waste \nby equipping each fulfillment center with an optimized \nsuite of packaging options. These mechanisms use \ncomplex algorithms to identify the best package options. \nThe tool is now used in Amazon fulfillment centers \nglobally to reduce waste.\nLearn more about PackOpt\u00a0\n.\nWe leverage technology to right-size packaging for deliveries. \nPrioritizing Recyclability \nand Carbon Impact\nWe seek to increase recycling rates for Amazon packaging \nand strive to enable curbside recyclability where available. \nWe use several packaging options to optimize for durability, \nperformance, and recyclability. These include paper-based \noptions, like boxes and paperboard envelopes, and plastic film \noptions, like plastic bags and air pillows. \nIn 2022, we used\u00a085,916 m etric tons of single-use plastic across \nour global operations network to ship orders to customers. \nThis represents an\u00a011.6% decrease from 97,222 metric tons \nin 2021.17 This decrease also contributed to a\u00a017.1% decrease \nin average plastic packaging weight per shipment in 2022 \nacross our global operations network, building on the\u00a0over \n7% reduction achieved in 2021. This was driven by expanding \npaper-based packaging and SIOC, and continuing use of lighter, \nmore flexible, right-sized packaging. \nWe are phasing out padded bags containing plastics in favor of \nrecyclable alternatives. During 2022, we expanded recyclable \npaper padded bag use across the U.S. and Canada, replacing \n99% of harder-to-recycle padded bags that contain both \nplastic and paper. We eliminated single-use plastic delivery \nbags for orders shipped from European fulfillment centers and \nreplaced them with curbside-recyclable alternatives. We also \neliminated single-use air pillows in Europe and Australia and \nreplaced them with curbside-recyclable paper material.\nToday, approximately 92%\u00a0of packaging material weight in the \nU.S. and Canada\u2014excluding produce bags and coolants\u2014is \ncurbside recyclable where programs are available. All EU \none-way delivery packaging\u2014excluding coolants\u2014is also \ncurbside recyclable. \nPartnering to Scale\nWe partner with industry peers and expert organizations, such \nas the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, to improve recycling \ninfrastructure. We also invest in developing foundational \nsolutions that address some of the broader issues with plastics. \nIn 2022, we joined the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s BOTTLE18 \nconsortium, led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory \n(NREL), to develop technology that will enable bio-based and \nbiodegradable plastic recycling. This is the beginning of a new \npath to make plastics with the benefits of paper, enabling \nlighter-weight packaging with lower carbon emissions.\nLooking Forward\nWe remain committed to enhancing our packaging for both \nperformance and sustainability. We have made notable \nprogress to date and, as we move through 2023 and beyond, \nwe\u00a0will seek to continue eliminating packaging through SIOC, \nreduce waste through automation and right-sizing, and select \nrecyclable materials where possible. \n29\n2022 Amazon Sustainability Report \n |"

The long term goal is to eliminate diesel \ngenerators in top production markets. \nSustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance: \nMaking a film or series requires air travel. To accelerate progress towards \nlowering the greenhouse gas emissions associated with burning jet fuel, \nNetflix co-founded the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA). \nSABA sends market signals to producers of Sustainable Aviation Fuel \n(SAF) to grow supply, facilitates coordinated procurement activity, and \nensures the environmental integrity of their claims. \nWe also actively partner with other key business and non \nprofit consortia to: (1) further our understanding of climate \nrepresentation on screen, including through BAFTA\u2019s \nAlbert, SPA and the Climate Entertainment Stakeholders \nRoll Call, a group organized by the Television Academy, \nAcademy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences , Creative \nArtists Agency, and PGA to connect the companies and \norganizations working in climate entertainment; and (2) \nadvocate for more sustainable policy solutions, including \nCERES, C2ES, the Business Roundtable and Motion \nPicture Association. \n24\nSustainability Strategy Sustainability in Our Operations and Value Chain Netting Remaining Emissions to Zero Sustainability in Storytelling\n Climate Risk\nEnvironment GovernanceSocialIntroduction Appendix",

We will scale \nsupply chain decarbonization by aligning \nfinancial and government leadership, to \nsignal global market demand and infuse \ninvestment into infrastructure and technology \nsolutions worldwide. \n4 Improving measurement: We cannot manage \nwhat we cannot measure.

            "24Netflix ESG Report 2022\nThe film and television industry is over a century old and has \nbeen traditionally powered by fossil fuels. While we have set \nNetflix-specific climate targets, we can\u2019t transition \nentertainment to a cleaner, low carbon industry alone. This is \nwhy we partner with other studios to ensure progress made \nby one benefits everyone \u2014 and because we believe \ncollective actions will yield positive outcomes, faster. \nWe do this through: \nINDUSTRY COLLABORATION Sustainable production industry groups: \nNetflix is a member of several industry groups globally (e.g., Sustainable \nProduction Alliance (global), BAFTA\u2019s Albert (UK and global), Reel \nGreen\/On Tourne Vert\/Ontario Green Screen (Canada), Green Motion \n(Germany), Sustainable Screens Australia, etc.) to help bring \ntransparency (e.g., Close Up: Carbon Emissions of Film & Television \nProduction) and public advocacy for sector transformation (e.g., \nhydrogen hub). \nClean Mobile Power Initiative: \nBy co-founding the Clean Mobile Power Initiative (CMPI) with support from \nnon-profit Rocky Mountain Institute and its climate accelerator, we aim to \nidentify and deliver cost-competitive zero emissions mobile power at scale \nfor the entertainment industry. The long term goal is to eliminate diesel \ngenerators in top production markets. \nSustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance: \nMaking a film or series requires air travel. To accelerate progress towards \nlowering the greenhouse gas emissions associated with burning jet fuel, \nNetflix co-founded the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA). \nSABA sends market signals to producers of Sustainable Aviation Fuel \n(SAF) to grow supply, facilitates coordinated procurement activity, and \nensures the environmental integrity of their claims. \nWe also actively partner with other key business and non \nprofit consortia to: (1) further our understanding of climate \nrepresentation on screen, including through BAFTA\u2019s \nAlbert, SPA and the Climate Entertainment Stakeholders \nRoll Call, a group organized by the Television Academy, \nAcademy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences , Creative \nArtists Agency, and PGA to connect the companies and \norganizations working in climate entertainment; and (2) \nadvocate for more sustainable policy solutions, including \nCERES, C2ES, the Business Roundtable and Motion \nPicture Association. \n24\nSustainability Strategy Sustainability in Our Operations and Value Chain Netting Remaining Emissions to Zero Sustainability in Storytelling\n Climate Risk\nEnvironment GovernanceSocialIntroduction Appendix",
