    "A semantic index is a method used to organize and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the content rather than just keywords. Unlike traditional keyword-based search systems, a semantic index understands the relationships between concepts and terms within the data, allowing for more accurate and relevant search results. In this context (i.e., ML and NLP), a semantic index leverages embeddings, which are numerical representations of words, phrases, or documents in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the content, enabling the system to identify similar or related items even if they do not share exact keywords. The following code creates a semantic index using Azure OpenAI embeddings. The embedding model is used to generate embeddings for the documents, which are then indexed using `VectorStoreIndex` from `llamaIndex`. This process allows for efficient and meaningful retrieval of information based on the semantic content of the documents."

These metrics provide insights into how accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate the AI-generated responses are.\n",
